# Villain Monologue Creation

## Summary
The program can be boiled down to a User-Input Creation Generator, which uses Python with the Flask microframework Interface to create a website that asks the user to inputs a word and outputs a randomized sentence that imitates something you would find within a villian`s monologue.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get accustomed with Python once more, after a long hiatus of C++ and Java, as well as learn the Flask framework and get a better grasp at web development using HTML/CSS. But mainly, it was for fun purposes and sounded like a cute idea at the time.

## Instructions
Assuming a Command Prompt usage and you have installed the proper packages onto your system:
-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project`s directory.
-run venv/scripts/activate in your command prompt.
-and then run app.py in the command prompt. 
-To access the webpage, go to your internet browser and type Localhost:5555.
-Enjoy



**UPDATE: After a hardware wipe, I`ll be checking at old projects and making sure they work Proper.**

**Update 2: Program functions but will add more options for dialogue for the sake of fun.**
