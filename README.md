# Villain Monologue Creation

## Summary
The program is a user-input word generator, which uses Python with the Flask microframework interface that asks the user via the frontend to input a word and outputs a randomized sentence that imitates something you would find within a villian`s monologue.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get acclimated with Python after a long hiatus, as well as begin to learn the Flask framework. It also helped as a refresher to web development using HTML/CSS. But mainly, it was for the sake of enjoyment.
